# AMCAT Employee Data: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on conducting an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the **Aspiring Minds Employment Outcomes (AMEO) 2015** dataset, which was collected through the AMCAT assessment. The primary aim of the analysis was to uncover insights related to job roles, salary trends, academic performance, gender dynamics, and geographic influences on employment outcomes.
